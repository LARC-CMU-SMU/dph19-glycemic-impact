Short paper accepted at 9th International Digital Public Health Conference (DPHâ€™ 19), ACM [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07881.pdf)

## Dataset
We crawled the 55k recipes from http://allrecipes.com and had 1000 recipes labelled by the AMT workers.
However, we were not allowed to release the 55k dataset (i.e. The dic_20190819.pickle I used in most of my notebooks)
As a result, I released the [dic_20191203.pickle](data/Downloads.md) file instead, which should be enough for reproducing more of my experiments except training the embeddings.
It contains 990 recipes instead of 55k recipes.

## Recipe54k-trained embeddings
This work involves a lot of embeddings trained on Recipe54k. As a result, I share the [trained embeddings](data/Downloads.md)

## Jupyter notebooks
### RQ1: Research Question 1
### RQ2: Research Question 2 ---> train models and save the results to csv/ and pickle/
