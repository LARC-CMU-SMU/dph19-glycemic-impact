### Dataset
We crawled the 55k recipes from http://allrecipes.com and had 1000 recipes labelled by the AMT workers.
However, we are not allowed to release the 55k dataset (i.e. The dic_20190819.pickle I used in most of my notebooks)
As a result, I want to release the dic_20191020.pickle file instead, which should be enough for reproducing more of my experiments.
It contains 1000 recipes instead of 55k recipes.

## Please find the jupyter notebooks in RQ1 and RQ2
### RQ1: Research Question 1
### RQ2: Research Question 2 ---> train models and save the results to csv/ and pickle/
